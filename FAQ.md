## Ubuntu Countdown Widget does not appear in widget list, but the settings are working! ##
You probably moved the application on SD: all widgets MUST be installed on internal memory.

## The widget didn't decrease days left/it changed days hours earlier or later! ##
The widget decrease days left using GMT+0 time zone, then there can be up to 12 hours of difference from the midnight of your time zone.
If the day of release is in a different daylight time there may be another hour of difference.
